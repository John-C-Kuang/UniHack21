> ## What it does
There are two groups of targeted users: every individual of the general public, and the government's health department (2GP & 2GOV). It takes a questionnaire-like form during the information collecting phase and returns the result to users based on the information entered.

**The General Public** can use the app to calculate their own risk of getting COVID-19, so they can make better decisions and choices to prevent their personal life & health.

**The Government** can use this app to quickly locate where suspected cases have occured, so that people may have got COVID-19 can be quickly identified and quarantined to cut off the further spreading of COVID-19 virus, causing bigger troubles. 

> ## How we built it

Our main coding language is Java. 

We use an MVC design scheme. 

We also used Java Swing to make the gui interactive page.

It is possible to convert this demo into a WeChat mini app, so that it can be utilized easier for everyone and make its contribution to the COVID-19 control.
